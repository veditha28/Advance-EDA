## 📁 Project 1: Power Consumption vs Weather Conditions (`/PowerVsWeather`)

### 🔍 Objective
Analyze how weather parameters (temperature, humidity, precipitation) influence household electricity consumption using minute-level power data and hourly weather records.

### 📊 Key Techniques
- Data merging and preprocessing
- Pearson correlation and lag analysis
- Rolling average smoothing
- KMeans clustering
- Data visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)

### 📁 Folder Structure
- `PowerVsWeather/`
  - Analysis notebooks/scripts
  - Processed datasets
  - Visualizations
  - Report: [`PowerVsWeather.pdf`](./PowerVsWeather/PowerVsWeather.pdf)

## 📁 Project 2: Titanic Passenger Survival Analysis (`/Titanic`)

### 🔍 Objective
Explore passenger demographics and travel features to understand survival patterns from the RMS Titanic disaster using structured EDA.

### 📊 Key Techniques
- Missing value imputation
- Univariate & bivariate analysis
- Label and one-hot encoding
- Correlation heatmaps
- Data visualization

### 📁 Folder Structure
- `Titanic/`
  - EDA scripts
  - Cleaned dataset
  - Visualizations
  - Report: [`titanic.pdf`](./Titanic/titanic.pdf)
